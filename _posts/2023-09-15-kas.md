# **How Kas Summer Went?!** ðŸ˜±
![Train ad](train.jpeg)
## Since my **junior** year was over, I really looked at life differently. Realizing that when September starts, it'll be my last first day of school. I started questioning myself,"What should I do this summer? What's the **next step now?**" I got two months and a half to ease my mind. I still wanted to keep working at my minimum-wage job but that was the only reason  I had to be out my house. Then I remembered: *I can start working out again.*
- Before I went into my junior year, my uncle invited me to go to the gym with him. And he was my inspiration
## I started. Whatever day I didn't have work, I hit the gym by myself. I did go one day with my friend though but we stayed for 5 minutes because of how packed it was. Exercising aside, when I was home I was just playing Roblox.
