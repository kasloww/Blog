# **Flask?..**
## When I heard the word Flask at first, I thought to myself,"Another difficult web factor is about to be added to my brain." Flask is a web framework that can take your code to a different level such as access to very unique Python libraries and overall making your web application more creative. What makes it different from regular HTML and CSS is that to use HTML and CSS in Flask you'll need what's called a Jinja file. When making the HTML code make sure the file has "jinja" after the file name so the HTML code can work. Then if you want you can add CSS in your head of the file. Though, if you have style that you don't want to be changed, you can have a seperate CSS file and put the code there. Fun fact with jinja templates, you can write python code in it! But there will be certain ways to use the python. Say for example you want to make a for loop. To do that you have to surround the for loop with curly brackets and a percent sign.
## Flask is still a challenging web framework for me so resources I should use in the near future to help me better understand it are slides from previous lessons, and probaby explore the internet to help with anything while I'm stuck on some few code.
## From the ToDo application to the social media website, I have went through a couple of trial and errors. There was this one part in the ToDo application where I didn't even know how to move on.

- I was confused on the int:todo_index part in the complete and delete routes; I lost track of what it was used for
## Then sometimes when it came to the SQL syntax, I always get them mixed up or I was probably missing something. For example, I used to use 'ALL' instead of * for SELECT and I wondered for awhile why it wasn't working. Slowly understanding it and looking back at the slides giving SQL definitions and examples for extra help.
## At last the social media website. Parts where I was confused on was the 'get db' that we've recently added to our code. I don't fully understand the use of it or why it replaced the other cursor code we had before but it's okay. Then some Bootsrap code wasn't working out for me. There was this time where I had tried to fix the sizing of a certain piece of *art* I wanted for the social media website to look more appealing. Now I'm stuck with barely finished backend code and a few syntax error for the forms. Speaking of the forms, making it in the Jinja was really difficult because I didn't know how to properly use the for loop and how to actually write the code because it works the same way our ToDo application worked. I had to dig deep and make it similar but different at the same time. Didn't work out for me. So I'm stuck in general.
