# **While Loops** ðŸ˜°
## Just hearing the word *"while"* creeps me out. I didn't really know how to use while loops off the top of my head. Though if I were given questions to answer to and I have to complete it by **using** a while loop, yeah I can do that. 
## The whole task for the project was to make a to-do list along with using while loops. At first, I didn't know that we were supposed to make a print statement first giving the list already. I thought we had to make the user start the list from scratch.

## I am so dissapointed in myself and I didn't realize it until Mr. Forlenza mentioned it to me: I was copy and pasting the "if" statement asking if the user wants to add or remove something in their list. That's why I said I didn't know the print statement was to start it off, I thought of it as making it from scratch. And the worse part is that I didn't use a while loop, only if's and for's statements..
