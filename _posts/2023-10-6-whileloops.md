# **While Loops** ğŸ˜°
<<<<<<< HEAD
## Just hearing the word *"while"* creeps me out. I didn't really know how to use while loops off the top of my head. Though if I were given questions to answer to and I have to complete it by **using** a while loop, yeah I can do that. 
## The whole task for the project was to make a to-do list along with using while loops. At first, I didn't know that we were supposed to make a print statement first giving the list already. I thought we had to make the user start the list from scratch.

## Mr. Forlenza gave us a project to create a to-do list by using while loops. I felt ready to work on it but when it actually came to writing the code, my brain left me.

## This sepcific line saved my life. I was copy and pasting the "for" loops but I didn't use the while loop. I was creating new varibles for no reason, but that didn't stop me. I had an idea of how
