# **"wall-et"**

## AI systems in the movie were used everywhere you looked. Every job a human should be doing, it was taken over by AI. There were AI for serving food, transportation, etc. They act as servants to humans; giving them want they want all the time, but AI don't feel anything - they just do what their programmed to do. As they're supposed to..

## There were many ethical dilemmas throught Wall-E. When the movie starts, it gives us a little view of how a small, rusty box shaped robot lived it's life. That robot encountered another one, yet the other one was white and was colored bright white - more clean. Since the white robot named Eve was on a search for something, Wall-E decided to follow the robot around. Because of that, Wall-E grew attached to Eve. 
- But AI shouldn't feel things..right?
## But when Eve found what it was looking for, it had a shut down procedure, "*something it was programmed to do*". And when Eve had shut down, there was a ship that claimed Eve like it was it's owner. Because the ship took Eve, Wall-E decided to follow it again knowing that he will be foerign to it and could end up *broken*? But did it know that being on the ship would mess up the whole  for the other AI's and robots.
